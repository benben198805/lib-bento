To build lib-bento you need to install CMake and Qt 4.7.4. Download the Qt libraries (debug and release) for your platform from ftp://ftp.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/.

To build lib-bento on Mac OS X and Linux:
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make

This also builds the Test app, which you can run:
	$ ./bin/BentoTest
